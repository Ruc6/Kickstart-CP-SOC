# Kickstart-CP-SOC
During the Summer of Code programme, I am gaining a solid foundation in competitive programming by learning key data structures and algorithms. I explored arrays, strings, and various sorting techniques, which helped strengthen my problem-solving skills. I also studied trees and binary trees, and learned traversal methods like DFS and BFS, which are essential for working with hierarchical data. Additionally, I was introduced to graphs and understood important concepts like time and space complexity, which play a crucial role in optimizing code. While I have made good progress, I am still working on strengthening my understanding of BFS, as I find it a bit challenging.
