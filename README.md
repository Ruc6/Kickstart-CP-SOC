# Kickstart-CP-SOC
During the Summer of Code programme, I am gaining a solid foundation in competitive programming by learning key data structures and algorithms. I explored arrays, strings, and various sorting techniques, which helped strengthen my problem-solving skills. I also studied trees and binary trees, and learned traversal methods like DFS and BFS, which are essential for working with hierarchical data. Additionally, I was introduced to graphs and understood important concepts like time and space complexity, which play a crucial role in optimizing code. While I have made good progress, I am still working on strengthening my understanding of BFS, as I find it a bit challenging. graph and Trie were focused data structures in week 5 through which various algorithms like Dijkstra, bellman, kruskal, prim were introduced. Greedy algorithms are used in week 6. It talked about concept of defining a particular property or quality for which the code can be greedy about and thus lead to optimal answer. Dynamic programming was topic for week 7, it focused bottom up and topdown approaches and also gave clarity on how to divide a problem into sub-overlapping problems such that previously calculated output could be reused and thus, saves time. Overall I enjoyed this project, and was actually a fun learning experience.
